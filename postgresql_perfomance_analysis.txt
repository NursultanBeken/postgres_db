## 1. PostgreSQL Statistics Collector
### PostgreSQL collects lots of data on its own and offers it via the pg_stat(io)_ system views
The statistics gathered by the module are made available via a view named pg_stat_statements. (more info in https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html)
Inorder to enable the module:
in postgresql.conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
pg_stat_statements.track = all
pg_stat_statements.max = 10000
track_activity_query_size = 2048

Then restart PostgreSQL. As a superuser from the psql console, run:
CREATE extension pg_stat_statements;

SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows, 100.0 * shared_blks_hit /
               nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
          FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 5;
